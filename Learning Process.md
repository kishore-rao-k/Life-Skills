# Learning Process

## What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique entails taking an idea, breaking it down into simple terms, and then, if you run into trouble, reviewing the source material to clarify and simplify complex parts.


## what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Dal√≠, the painter, had an interesting technique for boosting creativity. When he got stuck, he would hold his keys and relax, almost falling asleep. 
As he drifted off, the keys would slip from his hands and clatter to the floor, waking him up. This short nap helped him to shift from a diffuse mode of thinking to a focused mode, sparking new ideas.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

**Active (Focused) Mode:** We focus to a task and concentrate completly to make things happen. 
**Diffused Mode:**  This is a more relaxed, resting state of the brain.This mode is useful for creative thinking and getting new perspectives.
 
##  What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?
* Deconstruct the skill.
* Learn enough to self-correct.
* Remove practice barriers.
* Practice atleast 20 hours.

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
* **Use the Feynman Technique:** Explaining concepts in simple terms like teaching someone else.
* **Apply the Pomodoro Technique:** Practice focused learning with breaks in between like 30 minutes work and 5 minutes break.
* **Engage Focus Mode:** Use concentrated, uninterrupted sessions to tackle complex concepts.
