# Preventing Sexual Harassment in the Workplace

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can result from various types of behaviour. Any unwanted actions, words, or gestures of a sexual nature that make someone feel uncomfortable or create an uneasy environment are considered harassment. Examples include:

- **Verbal:** Harmful comments, offensive jokes, or remarks about a person’s physical appearance, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
- **Physical:** Unwanted physical contact such as touching, hugging, or other forms of closeness.
- **Non-Verbal:** Inappropriate staring, displaying obscene images, or making suggestive hand or body gestures.
- **Digital:** Sharing or sending inappropriate content such as emails or images that are not suitable for public viewing.
- **Power-Based:** Using authority or influence to coerce someone into performing sexual acts.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you encounter or observe sexual harassment, you can take the following steps:
-**Maintain a Written Record:** Document the incident, including dates, times, locations, and the individuals involved.
- **Address the Issue:** Politely but firmly tell the person that their behaviour is unacceptable and unwelcome (if it is safe to do so).
- **Report the Incident:** Inform your organisation’s HR department, supervisor, or the designated individual responsible for handling harassment complaints.
- **Seek Guidance and Support:** Confide in a trusted colleague, friend, or counsellor to receive advice and emotional support.
- **Familiarise Yourself with Policies:** Review the company’s sexual harassment policies and follow the procedures outlined.
- **Take Further Steps:** If the issue is not resolved, seek assistance from external authorities such as labour boards or law enforcement agencies.
