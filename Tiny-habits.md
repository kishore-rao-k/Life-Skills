# Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### What was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea in this video was finding the celebration that works for you after completing a task. The concept of focusing on “tiny successes” and allowing habits to grow naturally from small beginnings stood out.  
For example, instead of saying, "I’ll exercise for an hour," you could start with just one pushup after brushing your teeth. This approach feels both achievable and motivating.

### Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
#### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?  
To create new habits, start small, make them easy to do, and consistently enjoy the process.  
- **M (Motivation):** Your desire to perform the habit. While motivation fluctuates, it can be a starting point.  
- **A (Ability):** How easy it is to perform the habit. Simplifying the habit (e.g., making it shorter or requiring less effort) increases the likelihood of success.  
- **P (Prompt):** A trigger that reminds you to perform the habit. Attaching the habit to an existing routine ensures consistency.  

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?  
Celebration helps to create a positive emotional association with it. BJ Fogg highlights that whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.  
By smiling, saying “I did it!”, or doing a small fist pump after completing the habit, you reinforce the behavior and make it more rewarding and repeatable.

### 1% Better Every Day

#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most mindboggling idea was the compounding effect—how small, consistent improvements (just 1% better every day) can lead to transformative changes over time.

### Book Summary of *Atomic Habits*

#### What is the book's perspective about Identity?  
*Atomic Habits* argues that identity-based habits are more powerful than outcome-based habits. Instead of focusing on the result (e.g., "I want to lose weight"), focus on who you want to become (e.g., "I am someone who takes care of my body"). Aligning habits with your desired identity creates lasting change because you reinforce your sense of self with each action.

#### How to make a habit easier to do?  
The book suggests reducing friction for habits you want to adopt. Simplify the behavior, shorten the time required, or make the environment conducive.  
For example, if you want to start cycling, keep ready cycling gears the night before.

#### How to make a habit harder to do?  
To break a bad habit, increase friction. Make it less accessible or convenient.  
For example, if you want to stop snacking on junk food, keep it out of your house or place it in hard-to-reach locations.

### 5. Reflection

#### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What steps can you take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive, easy, or satisfying?
I want to become a better software engineer. To make this habit easier:  
- **Cue:** Keep a poster on my room or desk as a daily reminder.  
- **Attractive:** Pick tasks that genuinely excite me and reward myself for completing tasks.  
- **Easy:** Commit to reading just one DSA problem per day to ensure consistency.  
- **Satisfying:** Track my progress and celebrate each completed problem by sharing what I’ve learned with friends.

#### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What steps can you take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive, hard, or the response unsatisfying?  
I want to reduce overthinking. To make it harder to indulge:  
- **Cue:** Identify triggers and remove them (e.g., keep your phone away, change your environment).  
- **Unattractive:** Visualize how overthinking leads to stress, anxiety, and wasted time.  
- **Hard:** Create barriers (e.g., leave the room, change routines, or focus on mentally engaging tasks).  
- **Unsatisfying:** Remind yourself that overthinking brings no solutions—focus instead on meaningful, present-moment activities.
